BERTRAND MEYER: agile methods are one of the most important developments
in two decades of software engineering.
And I'm not exaggerating.
Everywhere in the industry, people are looking at agile methods
and often practicing them or some form of agile development.
Every software employer is going to give preference to candidates
that master agile concepts.
In this course, we are going to review agile methods so
that you can take the best out of them.
My name is Bertrand Meyer.
I'm a professor at Politecnico di Milano and Innopolis University.
And I was previously a ETH.
I also have another hat.
I am founder and CEO of a software company called Eiffel Software.
So I have this double experience-- academic on one side,
industrial on the other side.
And I hope you'll see that this course benefits from this dual experience.
Now, many presentations of agile methods are partisan.
They really want you to kneel down and to start praying
and adopt this or that agile method.
This one is different.
I'm not preaching one method or another.
The only thing I'm really preaching is software quality
and software productivity.
So we're going to see what agile methods are about.
But we're not going to advertise for a particular method.
And in fact-- surprise, surprise-- in agile methods,
there are some good aspects and some not so good aspects
as well, as in every human endeavor.
And it is very important to keep one's cool
and to decide what is best for you, for your project.
So this is going to be an analysis, without any bias,
of agile methods as they exist today.
The course is divided into six parts.
The first part presents the agile manifesto
and the context of agile methods.
The second part presents the agile principles--
what key methodological ideas underlie the agile movement.
The third one presents agile roles.
How does agile redefine traditional software jobs and tasks,
in particular, the manager's role?
The next part, the fourth one, highlights agile practices.
What are the concrete techniques that agile-type teams
use to apply the methods?
The next, and fifth, part describes the agile artifacts.
What practical tools are essential to the work of agile developers?
And the final part is an agile assessment.
Among agile ideas, which ones are essentially hyped and useless?
Which ones are actually harmful?
And which ones will truly help you produce software better?
In the words of the title of the textbook that goes with this course,
we look at the good, the hype, and the ugly.
I hope you enjoy this course.
Agile methods are one of the most important ideas on the software scene
today.
This course will enable you to master them and decide for yourself what
they can do for you, for your projects, and for your career.

## Introduction to week 1
 
INSTRUCTOR: This first lecture is called context, and as the name suggests
it introduces the fundamental ideas behind Agile methods
and the general background.
There's four segments.
The first segment is about the Agile manifesto.
That is, the foundational text that at the beginning of this century
introduced the fundamental Agile principles to the world.
Out of the manifesto, came a number of full-fledged methods.
And these methods are the topic of segment number two.
The methods embody the agile principles.
In segment three, we take a look at the key Agile principles,
as described in the Agile Manifesto.
That is to say, as seen by the originators of the Agile ideas.
Now, this is not necessarily, as we will see later the best
way to present Agile principles.
But this is what we will look at in segment three.
And finally, in segment four, we will review Agile values.
The values are at a more abstract level than the principles.
They are a kind of general philosophy that underlies the entire Agile
movement and from which everything else follows.
